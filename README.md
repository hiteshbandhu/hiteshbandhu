TL;DR : **Python Backend Engineer with an Expertise in Making Performant RAG/LLM Enabled Apps, Complete with Evaluations**

### namaste everyone ðŸ‘‹

Just a curious homosapien who feeds on data and manipulates language models. Music producer when in pain. New album soon btw    

Tech stack independent, but still, this **Django + Next.js** combo hits hard. I read ai papers, manipulate LLMs, make RAG pipelines, and drink coffee â˜•
